# Large Language Model (LLM) for Networking
* Topic: Large Language Model (LLM) for Networking
* Time: 16:00-17:30 March 20, Wednesday (Brisbane, Australia time)
* Location: Room P6-7
* Host: Yong Cui (Tsinghua University)
* IETF Side meeting wiki: https://wiki.ietf.org/meeting/119/sidemeetings#meeting-wednesday

## Motivations
Large language models (LLMs), exemplified by GPT, have achieved remarkable performance in various tasks, such as machine translation, text-to-image generation, and embodied intelligence. Thanks to their vast number of parameters, LLMs can memorize a massive amount of knowledge and utilize tools based on commands. We believe that LLMs can also assist with tasks within networking scenarios. This side meeting will explore the transformative potential of LLMs in the networking domain and open the discussion on potential standards for this topic.
